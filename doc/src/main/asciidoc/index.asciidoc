Composite Data Objects
----------------------

As a graph database Neo4j provides very good capabilities to model highly interconnected datastructures consisting of nodes and relationships. With release 2.0 a new concept of labels has been introduced. One or more number of labels can be added to a node:

[source]
----
create
  (n:PERSON)
set
  n.firstName="Dirk",
  n.lastName="Mahler"
----

This makes it possible to write comprehensive queries:

[source]
----
match
  (n:PERSON)
return
  n.firstName, n.lastName;
----

If a node has a label it can be assumed that this node represents some specific type of data which enforces the presence of specific properties and relationships (e.g. firstName, lastName for persons).
